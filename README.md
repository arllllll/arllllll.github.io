About the Project

This website is a place for pie. You will find recipes, resources, and a gallery of personal pie projects and bakeries I’ve visited. Most of the pies included in this site were made for people I love and it was a treat to revisit these pie memories. I have always loved pie but I am relatively new to baking them. I started about three years ago and it is one of my favorite things to do. 


About the project development:

Much like making a pie, making this website was an iterative process. I enjoyed the mental exercise of simultaneously attempting what felt like a puzzle, an organization challenge and a creative outlet. It is truly a lot like pie!

For the color palette, I wanted to go with shades you would find in a nice pie crust but found that it was very difficult to find multiple shades of yellow and golden that look lovely together– pie crust can do it, but I could not! So instead, I chose to base my color palette on my favorite frame from the film Portrait of a Lady on Fire.

It is such a beautiful movie and I’m fairly certain there is no pie in it. (My best attempt at yellow was rgb(241, 184, 11) for the header and rgb(255, 229, 124) for the navigation.)

For my heading fonts I wanted something a bit rounded and cozy, like a pie. For my recipe page I chose a typewriter font to mimic an old recipe card you might find in a recipe tin. My body font is Lora which I find to be a clean, light, and readable serif font. 

All of the content with the exception of the favicon, the Apple Pie recipe, and the information in the salt conversion table was written or made by me. Tom Crawford drew my favicon, a cute pie with a missing slice. Grace Gleason permitted me to include her Apple Pie recipe. I adapted an article from Masterclass for the salt table. I wanted to call the table, “Table Salt” but thought that might be a little confusing for the user.

After I had the main structure and the content filled in I considered how I might improve the user experience a bit. I added a hover element to the table and to the recipe instructions to help readers hold their place on the page. I would like to add a drop down menu to allow users to navigate more directly to the section they are interested in, rather than needing to scroll until they reach it. If I can figure out how to do it, I might add this after I turn it in!
