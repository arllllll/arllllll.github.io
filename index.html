  <h3>about the site</h3>
  <p>This website is a place for pie. You will find recipes, resources, and a gallery of personal pie projects and bakeries I’ve visited.

    <p>Pies are the perfect project and the title&mdash; lamination&mdash; refers to my favorite part of the pie and my favorite baking technique. Laminated dough is made when you repeatedly roll out and fold together butter and dough, creating many thin layers. This slow and careful accumulation of layers protects the butter from leaking away. To do this well you must remain attentive and reactive to what you are creating. <!--This beautiful process results in a structure that will delicately shatter and flake but stay strong enough to contain and support the filling.-->
      Lamination doesn’t have to be precise. Precision will never be better than your attention and care for the dough.</p>
  <p>
    Every time I make a pastry crust I am truly delighted that flour, butter, water, and heat can make something so incredibly beautiful and delicious.

  <h3>my first pie</h3>
  <p>I baked my first pie in October 2020 over Zoom with my sister Grace. We started baking together over Zoom in early 2020 while we were both stuck at home, I was in Portland, OR and she was in Wisconsin. My first pie was made according to her recipe which she won an award for from her local food co-op and is included on the recipe page. The filling was delicious but my technique for making the crust left it tough and dry. Over the next few years I made dozens of pies, attending to my dough and the science of lamination. Every time I make a crust I am truly delighted that flour, butter, water, and heat can make something so incredibly beautiful and delicious. </p>
